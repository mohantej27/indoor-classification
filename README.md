#indoor scene classification using VGG19 and CNN classifier

#ABSTRACT


This project is titled “INDOOR SCENE CLASSIFICATION USING VGG-19 AND CNN CLASSIFIER”. This software provides the facility to upload the images and get the classification of indoor scene. Any number of images can be uploaded. This project uses deep-learning methods and computer vision to identify indoor scene from pictures. First, we use convolutional neural networks to classify scene for each image. We then compare a number of classification algorithms that use certain features to predict the indoor scene shown in the image. We use pre-trained VGG-19, CNN and were able to classify “indoor scene” of different categories with high accuracy and had the best performance.
